# Advent Of Code 2024
This is my solution repository for the advent of code 2024. 
This year again in python

## Repository Structure
For one of the earlier years i set myself up a file reader, which is in utils.
Each day has its separate folder with an individual test, test's assets and daily assets folder.
- in the daily assets folder there is the input.txt as generated by advent of code, but this is on gitignore
- the test's assets has the example input from the explanation on the AoC daily page.
- the test folder has a single test file that expects from the main file a function part_one and part_two, and uses the example from the AoC page.

For the next day, do these steps
- copy previous day, rename accordingly folder and filename
- replace input.txt from page, and copy-paste example from page for test input
- adapt test file pointing to new folder and file in import statements. Insert test values from example on AoC page
- the daily main script should work out-of-box with removing everything from the previous day, but keep main, part_one and part_two
